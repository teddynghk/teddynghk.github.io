** Aim **

- The website is to help users write an article faster and continuously under customised word or time limit. 
- This project includes using HTML, CSS and jQuery.

---


The structure of the website is mainly divided into 3 part:


1. Homepage.html

	- Users could choose their own time or word limit. A random topic could also be provided when requested.

2. Write.html

	- Users have to keep writing until they reach the time or word limit. If they stop writing, a fading animation will be added on the screen.

3. Blog.html (Still working)

	- This page is used to share articles or idea about writing.
